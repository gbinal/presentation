### Background 
* Background on APIs in Government
* Why APIs?  
  * [Weather.gov](http://www.weather.gov/) vs. [weather apps](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=weather&c=apps&hl=en)
* Read APIs
  * [State Alerts API](http://www.state.gov/developer/)
* Write APIs 
  * Passport renewal
  * IRS Tax Filing
* Takeaways:  
  * Current projects and all future projects should be API-first. 
  * Doing this will save you money and make your users happier and more productive, which will lead to people using your service more.  
  * This is not a fad.  It's the next step.  Paper -> Webpage -> API
