* Where I'm coming from.
* Why APIs?  
  * Weather 
* Read APIs
  * [State Alerts API](http://www.state.gov/developer/)
  * Passport renewal
  * IRS Tax Filing

  * Going forward, everything you build 
  * You will want an API for everything
  * Doing this will save you money and make your users happier and more productive, which will lead to people using your service more.  
  * This is not a fad.  It's the next step.  Paper -> HTTP -> API
